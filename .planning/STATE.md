## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases for v1, vehicle integration (CarPlay/Android Auto) deferred to v2
- [Roadmap]: Sensor + audio foundation is Phase 1 (highest risk, validate early)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: CarPlay entitlement should be submitted early even though implementation is v2 (weeks-long approval)
- [Research]: Android sensor throttling varies by OEM - must validate on Samsung/Pixel/OnePlus early in Phase 1
- [Research]: Bluetooth audio adds 100-300ms latency - may need user warning
